<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<ol>
<li><p class="question">Is there a problem format?</p>
<p class="answer">
There are currently three problem domains, as described
on <a href="http://fmrchallenge.org">the website</a>, and each has its own
problem format. The problem format for the first challenge domain has been
released for some time now, and an example of how controller code provided by
the teams will be run can be found in
the <a href="http://docs.fmrchallenge.org">User's Guide</a>.

<li><p class="question">How will submissions be evaluated?</p>
<p class="answer">
Currently the only available evaluation is entirely based on Monte Carlo trials,
where scoring is obtained from satisfaction of the task specification and
performance metrics. The duration for each trial is provided as part of the
problem instance in some cases, and it is randomly generated in others. This
statistical approach to evaluation has well-known limitations in deciding
correctness of solutions. However, it permits a great variety of possible
controllers because essentially no internal structure of solutions is assumed.
We are considering other methods of evaluation that require certain forms of
solutions and allow correspondingly stronger assertions.

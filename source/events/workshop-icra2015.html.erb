<h2>statement of purpose</h2>
<p>
The term "formal methods" refers broadly to techniques for the verification and
automatic synthesis of systems that satisfy desirable properties exactly or
within some statistical tolerance.  Historically developed for concurrent
software, recent work has brought these methods to bear on motion planning in
robotics. Challenges specific to robotics, such as uncertainty and real-time
constraints, have motivated extensions and entirely novel treatments which draw
on ideas from automata theory, logic, model checking, hybrid systems and
control.  However, compared to other areas of robotics research, demonstrations
of formal methods have been surprisingly small-scale. In addition, there is a
lack of benchmarks and metrics for evaluating novel algorithms.
</p>
<p>
This half-day workshop will bring together leading researchers in robotics,
formal methods and hybrid systems, including those from industry. The
discussions will be focused on metrics for evaluating the state of the art of
formal methods for synthesis and verification of robotic systems, including the
construction of appropriate benchmarks. This workshop will build on the success
of its predecessors

These previous events have tended toward broad inclusion of relevant work,
motivated in part by the nascency of the field.  We propose to focus this
manifestation of the series
at <a href="http://www.icra2015.org/"><acronym title="International Conference
on Robotics and Automation">ICRA</acronym> 2015</a> on benchmarks and metrics
for evaluation. It will also provide a venue for discussing preparations and
results from <a href="http://fmrchallenge.org">the First Challenge on Formal
Methods for Robotics</a>.

<h2 id="workshopagenda">tentative agenda</h2>

The workshop will take place during the morning of Saturday, 30 May 2015.

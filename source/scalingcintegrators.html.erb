The <em>scaling double integrators</em> domain is the simplest in terms of
dynamics, yet unlike the other domains, the system to be controlled can be
scaled easily to arbitrarily many dimensions.  While this problem is abstract in
the sense that it is not modeling a specific physical system, it is
well-motivated because the double-integrator is just the basic force equation
\( F=ma \) of Newtonian mechanics, up to a scaling factor.  In other words, this
problem domain concerns acceleration of a point-mass in high-dimensional spaces
so as to visit goal regions and avoid obstacles.

<h3 class="pdomain">Dynamics and constraints</h3>
<p>
Let \( n \) be a positive integer.
\begin{equation}
\ddot{q} = u ,
\label{eq:doubleinteg}
\end{equation}
where \( q(t)\in \mathbb{R}^{n} \) and \( \dot{q}(t) \) are called the <em>position</em>
and <em>velocity</em>, respectively, at time \( t \).  The input is bounded as
\( \lVert u(t) \rVert_1 \leq u_{\mathrm{max}} \).  To introduce process and sensor
noise, consider the 2-dimensional system
\begin{align}
\dot{x} &= \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}
\right) x + \left(
\begin{array}{c}
0 \\
1
\end{array}
\right) u + \xi \label{eq:dintegdyn}\\
y &= \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0
\end{array}
\right) x + \eta \label{eq:dintegobs},
\end{align}
where \( \xi \) and \( \eta \) are either bounded disturbances (nondeterministic) or
stochastic processes.  Equivalence with \eqref{eq:doubleinteg} in the case of
\( n=1 \) and \( \xi=\eta=0 \) is apparent using \( x_1 = q \) and \( x_2 = \dot{q} \).  For \( n
> 1 \), the matrices in \eqref{eq:dintegdyn} and \eqref{eq:dintegobs} can be
repeated in block diagonal form to yield a new linear time-invariant system of
dimension \( 2n \) and which is again equivalent to \eqref{eq:doubleinteg}.

For this aspect of the ``scaling double-integrators'' problem domain, we are
able to vary the number of position dimensions \( n \), the maximum 1-norm of the
control input \( u_{\mathrm{max}} \), and the process and sensor noise \( \xi \) and
\( \eta \).

<h3 class="pdomain">Specifications</h3>
<p>
Task specifications will require visitation of regions while avoiding obstacles.
These can be regarded as a slight extension beyond classical motion planning.
There are two forms of specifications:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dinteg-surveillance}
q(0) = \mathrm{init} \wedge \Galways \left( q(t) \notin \mathrm{Obs} \right) \wedge \bigwedge_{i} \Galways \Feventually \mathrm{goal}_i
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dinteg-timedreach}
q(0) = \mathrm{init} \wedge \Galways \left( q(t) \notin \mathrm{Obs} \right) \wedge \bigwedge_{i} \left( \mathrm{counter}_i \leq T_{i} \right) \Uuntil \mathrm{goal}_i ,
\end{equation}
where \( \mathrm{Obs} \subset \mathbb{R}^n \) is the obstacle set, which is
represented by a finite union of polytopes.  For each \( i \), \( \mathrm{counter}_i \)
is a discrete clock that enforces the real-time deadline \( T_i \) of reaching
region \( \mathrm{goal}_i \).  Goal region \( \mathrm{goal}_i \) is defined by a convex
polytope.  The initial position is a single point, \( \mathrm{init}\in
\mathbb{R}^n \).  As part of the specification form \eqref{eq:dinteg-timedreach},
a time of initialization and rate of progression of the discrete counters is
specified.  These are significant because they determine in what order and how
quickly the goal regions must be reached.

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We present the first challenge on formal methods for robotics, which will be
held at <a href="http://www.icra2015.org/">ICRA 2015</a> as
a <a href="http://www.icra2015.org/conference/robot-challenges">Robot
Challenge</a>.  Formal methods refers broadly to techniques for the verification
and automatic synthesis of transition systems that satisfy desirable properties
exactly or within some statistical tolerance.  Though historically developed for
concurrent software, recent work has brought these methods to bear on motion
planning in robotics.  Challenges specific to robotics, such as uncertainty and
real-time constraints, have motivated extensions to existing methods and
entirely novel treatments.  However, compared to other areas within robotics
research, demonstrations of formal methods have been surprisingly small-scale.
The proposed robotics challenge seeks to motivate advancement of the state of
the art toward practical realization.  The challenge is organized into three
problem domains: arbitrary dimensional chains of integrators, roads with Dubins
cars, and factory cart clearing.</p>

<p>
The <em>scaling chains of integrators</em> domain is the simplest in terms of
dynamics, yet unlike the other domains, the system to be controlled can be
scaled easily to arbitrarily many dimensions.  While this problem is abstract in
the sense that it is not modeling a specific physical system, it is
well-motivated because the double-integrator is just the basic force equation
\( F=ma \) of Newtonian mechanics, up to a scaling factor.  Informally, this
problem domain concerns controlling acceleration or a higher order derivative of
a point-mass in high-dimensional spaces so as to visit goal regions and avoid
obstacles.

<div class="psetting" id="dubinstraffic">
<h3>traffic network of Dubins cars</h3>

<p>
The <em>traffic network of Dubins cars</em> domain involves navigation in a small network of
two-lane roads with vehicles that have Dubins car dynamics.  There is an
adversary that selects the motion of other cars.  The adversary is subject to
assumptions such as obeying traffic rules and not parking unfairly at locations
that must be eventually reached by the controller.

<div class="psetting" id="cartclearing">
<h3>factory cart clearing</h3>
<img src="img/pandp_illustration.png" alt="Illustration of a Baxter robot next to an empty table.  The arms are hanging downward and not in motion." />
<p>
The <em>factory cart clearing</em> domain concerns dexterous manipulation tasks
motivated by assembly line activities.  The robot is required to process objects
laid out on a cart that is brought to it and sort them into bins. Carts arrive
after the robot indicates that it is ready, and carts are removed once a robot
declares that it is done. Scoring will be based on how many carts can be
processed correctly (described below) in a fixed amount of time.

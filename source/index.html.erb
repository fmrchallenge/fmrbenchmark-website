<h2 id="callICRA2016">Call for Participation</h2>
<p>
We invite teams to participate in the first challenge on formal methods for
robotics, to be held at <a href="http://www.icra2016.org">ICRA 2016</a> as a
Robot Challenge. Compared to other areas within robotics research,
demonstrations of formal methods have been surprisingly small-scale. The
proposed robotics challenge seeks to motivate advancement of the state of the
art toward practical realization. The challenge is organized into three problem
domains: arbitrary dimensional chains of integrators, roads with Dubins cars,
and factory cart clearing. Each team may enter any number of control programs,
each of which may be used on any subset of the problem domains. Results of the
challenge will be organized by problem domains, and control programs will be
scored based on performance within each domain as well as across domains when
more than one is attempted by the same controller.  Preparation materials
including reference implementations and further details about scoring and
logistics will be released in the upcoming months. Interested teams are directed
to the challenge website
at <a href="http://fmrchallenge.org">http://fmrchallenge.org</a>, which includes
directions for subscription to the challenge mailing list.

<h2 id="problems">Problem Domains</h2>
<p>Below is a summary of <em>problem domains</em>, each of which is the basis
for particular <em>problem instances</em>. With such a taxonomy, we are able to
provide parameterized benchmarks that can be arbitrarily scaled, randomly
generated, etc. Of course, there is also support for fixed benchmarks, e.g., as
proposed from specific industrial applications. Normative
descriptions are given at <a href="/norm/"><tt>fmrchallenge.org/norm</tt></a>.

<p>
The <em>scaling chains of integrators</em> domain is the simplest in terms of
dynamics, yet unlike the other domains, the system to be controlled can be
scaled easily to arbitrarily many dimensions.  While this problem is abstract in
the sense that it is not modeling a specific physical system, it is
well-motivated because the double-integrator is just the basic force equation
\( F=ma \) of Newtonian mechanics, up to a scaling factor.  Informally, this
problem domain concerns controlling acceleration or a higher order derivative of
a point-mass in high-dimensional spaces so as to visit goal regions and avoid
obstacles.

<h3>traffic network of Dubins cars</h3>

<p>
The <em>traffic network of Dubins cars</em> domain involves navigation in a small network of
two-lane roads with vehicles that have Dubins car dynamics.  There is an
adversary that selects the motion of other cars.  The adversary is subject to
assumptions such as obeying traffic rules and not parking unfairly at locations
that must be eventually reached by the controller.

<div class="psetting" id="cart_clearing">
<h3>factory cart clearing</h3>
<img src="img/pandp_illustration.png" alt="Illustration of a Baxter robot next to an empty table.  The arms are hanging downward and not in motion." />
<p>
The <em>factory cart clearing</em> domain concerns dexterous manipulation tasks
motivated by assembly line activities.  The robot is required to process objects
laid out on a cart that is brought to it and sort them into bins. Carts arrive
after the robot indicates that it is ready, and carts are removed once a robot
declares that it is done. Scoring will be based on how many carts can be
processed correctly (described below) in a fixed amount of time.

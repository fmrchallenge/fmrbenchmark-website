  <h1>Workshop on Formal Methods For Robotics: <span class="subtitle">Benchmarks and Evaluation Metrics<span></h1>

    <h2>statement of purpose</h2>
    <p>
    The term "formal methods" refers broadly to techniques for the verification and
    automatic synthesis of systems that satisfy desirable properties exactly or
    within some statistical tolerance.  Historically developed for concurrent
    software, recent work has brought these methods to bear on motion planning in
    robotics. Challenges specific to robotics, such as uncertainty and real-time
    constraints, have motivated extensions and entirely novel treatments which draw
    on ideas from automata theory, logic, model checking, hybrid systems and
    control.  However, compared to other areas of robotics research, demonstrations
    of formal methods have been surprisingly small-scale. In addition, there is a
    lack of benchmarks and metrics for evaluating novel algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
    This half-day workshop will bring together leading researchers in robotics,
    formal methods and hybrid systems, including those from industry. The
    discussions will be focused on metrics for evaluating the state of the art of
    formal methods for synthesis and verification of robotic systems, including the
    construction of appropriate benchmarks. This workshop will build on the success
    of its predecessors
    at <a href="http://verifiablerobotics.com/ICRA09/index.html"><acronym title="International
    Conference on Robotics and Automation">ICRA</acronym> 2009</a>,

    These previous events have tended toward broad inclusion of relevant work,
    motivated in part by the nascency of the field.  We propose to focus this
    manifestation of the series
    at <a href="http://www.icra2015.org/"><acronym title="International Conference
    on Robotics and Automation">ICRA</acronym> 2015</a> on benchmarks and metrics
    for evaluation. It will also provide a venue for discussing preparations and
    results from <a href="http://fmrchallenge.org">the First Challenge on Formal
    Methods for Robotics</a>.

    <li class="agenda">abstract for the first invited talk, <q>Formal methods at Galois Inc: current results, ongoing work, and future challenges</q> by <a href="https://galois.com/team/peter-trautman/">Peter Trautman (Galois, Inc.)</a>:
    <blockquote class="agenda">Galois Inc. is a small software company that applies formal methods to computer science problems to build trustworthy systems.  Historically, Galois has focused on “low-level” issues, such as cryptography, security, and software correctness.  However, with the growing prevalence of automation in everyday systems, the need for “low-level” trustworthy systems has become imperative across a broad range of applications.  In particular, Galois’ work on the DARPA program called High Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) resulted in the <a href="http://galois.com/blog/2015/02/60-minutes-galois/">“world’s most secure UAV software”</a>; additionally, common security vulnerabilities in modern automobiles and small UAVs were diagnosed and rectified using formal methods during this effort.  Recently, Galois’ interest in formally verified robotics algorithms has grown, and we are currently exploring vulnerabilities in the ROS navigation stack, as well as high assurance human in the loop architectures.   In general, an interesting research topic is simultaneously emerging from our software and robotics research teams: how does one apply formal methods to interacting probabilistic modules?</blockquote></li>

    <li class="agenda">abstract for the second invited talk, <q>Reproducible experimental workflows though protocol programming languages</q> by <a href="http://klavinslab.org/">Eric Klavins</a> (<a href="http://www.washington.edu/">U. Washington</a>):
    <blockquote class="agenda">I will describe several recent efforts to standardize how protocols and workflows are specified using formal, executable programming languages. Writing protocols in these languages could lead to a revolution in how experimental work is done. I will then describe briefly my lab’s experience with Aquarium, our human-in-the-loop laboratory operating system that you can use to run experimental workflow programs reliably and reproducibly.</blockquote></li>
